# OSA-Zoog-Mk2
Cheap and disposable stealth skiff, made without FCU/MFC to shave print cost.

Made as a disposable ship and assult pod for up to 2 people, there may not be a cheaper, more stress free way to zerg into the fight.

For a total of 4 stacks of t1 ore, and a print cost of 22 001 credits print without crafting parts, i can confidently say it does not get cheaper than this for brave one way trips.

For good measure, i made a 5 pod launcher varient, giving you possibly one of the most affordable stealth bombers to have fun with.

//Specs//

Comes unarmed for scouting or with 5 missiles for bombardment.

LaunchMissile+ and LaunchTube+ are your missile triggers, bind both to the same key, this system uses no yolo and is a simple way to cycle and launch missile tubes.

148 m/s max speed using T1 manoeuvre thrusters, no trails.

68277.5234 kg in weight without missiles, 74437.3047 kg armed with missiles.

One small prop tanks for 1 million prop, 40 mins estimated flight time.

One T1 fuel chamber + one T1 generators, gens must be ran at max to fly.

Roll is performed using Roll_Left and Roll_Right buttons.

This ship has no FCU/MFC, it is manualy ballanced, and uses direct lever control.

See attached photo of bindings for this ship.

This is done to make the print cost incredibly low, and further make a cheap ship cheaper.

//Tactics//

Zerging the enemy has been, and alway will be a strong method to win, low to no cost attacks with handheld weapons is the simplest form of combat.

It is also the basis for station assult, so i made the Zoog.

Cheaply printed even withont tech tree unlocks, fast and stealthy, can be used by anyone as a easy trip into combat.

Has to pilot seats for pilots to fly based on preference, doubles as a passenger seat to allow two endos per trip.

The missile varient takes full advantage of te near zero cost of the hull, allowing you to deploy 5 missiles with next to no ship cost attached, it is basicaly the launcher and missiles.

Idealy the launcher will be used to breach stations during siege, but i also expect it to be used as a risk free way to deploy some missiles.
